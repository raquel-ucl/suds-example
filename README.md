# Python's `suds` example

Teaching myself some SOAP with __suds__.

This will be needed by one of the projects I work on at UCL called [ORACC](https://github.com/UCL-RITS/nammu).

To run this example you need to install _suds_, for example: `pip install suds`.

To run the examples:

```
git clone https://github.com/raquel-ucl/suds-example.git
cd suds-example
python client.py <url_to_wsdl>
```

This will print out the list of method signatures accesible from the given url.

There are also some examples on how to access and call methods in sample wsdl files.
